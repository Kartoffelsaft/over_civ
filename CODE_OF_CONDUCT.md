Code Of Conduct
===============

This applies to all areas related to this project in all forms and locations.

1. Be kind, to others and to the project.

3. Be on topic, to others and to the project.

2. Be logical, to others and to the project.

4. Be clear and comprehensive in information, especially in code, issue discussions, and documentation, but strive to be in all cases.

Higher listed takes precedence over lower.
This is kept purposefully succinct so as to be more general and inclusive, rather than limiting by giving precise examples.
Delegate all case-specific questions about conduct to the project maintainers.
